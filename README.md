## GW-48T02-1, a Replacement Module for the 48T08

This project allows complete replacement of the "CAPHAT" potted module on a 48T02 RTC/NVRAM, replacing both the battery and the crystal. It uses a CR1225 cell in a holder for easy serviceability. It is only slightly taller than the original 48T02 (approximately 1.25 mm/0.05 in) which allows for clearance under mezzanine boards, such as the SBus slots on a SPARCstation 2. A full writeup on the design and instructions for installing it is available here:

When assembled and installed on a donor 48T02 IC, they look like this:
